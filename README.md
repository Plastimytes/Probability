This is a repository to learn probability and statistics in jupyter
Statistics 

Mean median mode etc

There's probably more

Lot's practice is required but it related to python <br>

Events->Joint probability->Conditional probability

Commenting is usually the same as in python files 

Joint probability=event(A)n event(B)

Conditional probability=Joint probability/event(b)

Conditional probability is basically The intersection of A and B Given probabiloity of B

Type 1 errors occur when we incorrectly reject a null hypothesis that is actually true. In simpler terms it is like saying someting has a significant effect when it actual sense it does not. They are often called false postives because it is claimed that an effect or difference is found when there really isn't one

Hypothesis tests include T tests, Z tests, ANOVA tests  and  Chi square tests.<br>
Hypothesis testing is important to find if certain theories prove right in a given sample space<br>


For marginal probability one might want to use a feature_engine
Crosstab is used to compare variables
